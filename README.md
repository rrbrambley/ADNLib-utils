Message Beast
===========

Message Beast is a robust library geared towards building single-user, non-social applications that rely on App.net [Messages](http://developers.app.net/docs/resources/message/) as a means of personal cloud storage. Some simple applications that could be built with Message Beast include:
* a to-do list, 
* a personal journal,
* an expense tracker,
* a time-tracking app (e.g. for contracters to track time to bill clients)

... and really any type of single-user utility app that would benefit from having data backed up to the cloud.

Typically, an application built with Message Beast might rely on one or more private App.net Channels as a means of storing Messages. In this context, try to think of a Message as a unit of data more akin to a row in a database table – not in the traditional way you hear the word "messages," i.e., like in a chat room.

Some key features of Message Beast are:

1. **Full Channel syncing**. Since Channels of data will be owned and accessed by a single user, there will typically be a relatively small amount of Messages (maybe between a few dozen and a few hundred). All Messages in a Channel can thus be synced and persisted to a sqlite database on your device, upon first launch. For new users of your application, this would more or less be a no-op, but for users switching between devices or platforms, you can ensure their data is easily synced and accessible.
2. **Offline Message support**. Messages can be created and used when offline. If no internet connection is available, then the unsent Messages can live happily alongside the sent Messages in the user interface. When an internet connection is eventually available, then the unsent Messages will be sent to the proper App.net Channel. No more progress spinners or long waits after hitting the "post" button in an app. This works for all types of Messages, including those with OEmbeds and file attachments.
3. **Mutable actions can be performed on Messages**. App.net supports the use of [Annotations](developers.app.net/docs/meta/annotations/) on Messages, but unfortunately they are not mutable. Message Beast introduces the concept of **Action Messages**, which work around this limitation. For example, in a journaling application, you might want to be able to mark a journal entry as a "favorite." And later, you might want to say it is no longer a "favorite." This can be achieved with Action Messages in Message Beast.
4. **Full text search**. All Messages stored in the sqlite database are candidates for full-text search. This means you can build features that let users easily find old Messages in an instant.
5. **Loads of other data lookups**. Other than full-text search, you can lookup messages by location, hashtag, date, or by occurrence of any Annotation that you wish.
